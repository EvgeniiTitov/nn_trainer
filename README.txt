Built-in PyTorch Neural Nets Trainer

Python/Torch module that allows to take neural networks already implemented in the PyTorch framework
and train them to solve your problem. All you need is your own custom dataset in the ImageFolder
format. Gives a good idea as to what nets perform better for your problem, so that you can go ahead
and manually tune and test the promising ones.
